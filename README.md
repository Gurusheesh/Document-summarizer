## Technical Approach (200 words)

**Problem-Solving Strategy**: Built a client-side solution to minimize complexity while maximizing functionality. Used established libraries (PDF.js, Tesseract.js) for reliable text extraction and integrated AI services for intelligent summarization.

**Architecture**: Single-page application with progressive enhancement - starts with basic upload, adds processing capabilities, and culminates in AI-powered analysis. The two-step interface guides users through the process while maintaining simplicity.

**UX Focus**: Prioritized user feedback with loading states, error handling, and responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices. The drag-and-drop interface provides immediate visual feedback, while the clean typography hierarchy makes the interface scannable.

**Technical Decisions**: Chose vanilla JavaScript over frameworks to keep the bundle size minimal and deployment simple. PDF.js handles complex document parsing, while Tesseract.js enables OCR for images. Cohere API provides reliable summarization with customizable parameters.

**Performance Considerations**: Implemented progressive loading states and error boundaries to handle large files gracefully. The application processes documents entirely client-side, ensuring user privacy and reducing server costs.

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Firefox

Note on Security: For this demonstration, the API key is included in the client-side code for ease of deployment. In a production environment, this key would be secured on a backend server and accessed via a serverless function proxy to protect it.
